### TOOLS USED 
 * Android Studio
 * Yelp Fusion API
 * Volley
 * RelativeLayout to display results (despite being buggy)

### WHAT WE LEARNED 
Sometimes the API does not work like it should but that is ok

### üë©‚Äçüíª FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS 
We would like to have the results displayed properly from the API through using zipcode and city as well as expanding it to across the country
