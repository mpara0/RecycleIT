# RecycleIT
Final Project 

#ABOUT 
RecycleIT is an Android Application to promote sustainability by encouraging users to recycle. 
Our main feature of the app is the search bar where the user can input a city and locations of where to recycle will appear

#TOOLS USED üõ†Ô∏è
Android Studio, Yelp Fusion API, Volley, and RelativeLayout to display results (despite being buggy)

#FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
We would like to have the results displayed properly from the API through using zipcode and city as well as expanding it to across the country
